# Healthcare Operations Analytics Platform

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data engineering and analytics pipeline** built on healthcare operational data. The objective is to transform raw data into clean, analytics-ready datasets and deliver actionable insights through SQL and Power BI dashboards.

The project mirrors real-world healthcare analytics workflows used in enterprise environments.

## 🏥 Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations generate large volumes of operational data across appointments, diagnostics, and billing systems. This data is often inconsistent and siloed, making it difficult to monitor efficiency, revenue, and patient distribution.

This project addresses the problem by:
- Designing a structured ETL pipeline
- Ensuring data quality and validation
- Building a relational analytics database
- Creating business-focused dashboards

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Data Engineering:** Pandas, SQLite  
- **Database:** SQL (Relational schema design)  
- **Analytics & Visualization:** Power BI  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
